# WeChatAPI
WeChatAPI is a 3rd-party API written in C# for WeChat, the most popular IM app in China.

It has been decided that we will close source. Nevertheless, the team will update the GitHub repository with the latest demo. Also, the wiki will be kept up-to-date.

## How to Get Started
It's simple. Just clone the repository and run the demo app. It shall present all the features we've finished.

If you want a overview of how the API actually works, please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/WeChatAPI/wiki).

## Contributing
You should really join our team if you want to contribute because we've decided not to open source.

Please refer to the project [Wiki](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/WeChatAPI/wiki) for roadmap and instructions.

(I am sitll writing the Wiki. Your help to complete it will be highly appreciated)
